This repo aims to give you clear instructions on how to install, config, and use wireguard in your local network. The [Wiki](#docs) below will guide you to deploy [Wireguard Server](https://www.wireguard.com/) on the Cloud.

## Introduction

**[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)** is a free and open-source software application and communication protocol that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point connections in routed or bridged configurations. It is run as a module inside the Linux kernel (or the BSD kernel), and aims for better performance and more power saving than the IPsec and OpenVPN tunneling protocols.
